# Generator Pattern in Go Concurrency

The generator pattern in Go is a concurrency design pattern that uses goroutines and channels to produce a stream of values on-demand. It allows you to create functions that generate sequences of data asynchronously, enabling lazy evaluation and non-blocking data production.

## How it works

A generator function typically returns a channel and starts a goroutine that sends values to that channel. The consumer can then range over the channel to receive values as they're produced.

## When it's useful

- **Data streaming**: When you need to process large datasets without loading everything into memory at once. For example, reading and processing large files line by line.

- **Pipeline processing**: Building data processing pipelines where each stage can work independently and concurrently.

- **Rate-limited operations**: When you need to control the pace of data production, such as making API calls with rate limiting.

- **Infinite sequences**: Generating potentially infinite streams of data, like Fibonacci numbers or random values.

- **Decoupling producers and consumers**: When you want to separate the logic of data generation from data consumption.

## Pros

- **Memory efficiency**: Only generates values as needed, preventing memory bloat with large datasets.
- **Concurrency**: Producers and consumers can work simultaneously, improving overall throughput.
- **Clean separation of concerns**: Clearly separates generation logic from consumption logic.
- **Composability**: Generators can be easily chained and combined to create complex data processing pipelines.
- **Backpressure handling**: Unbuffered channels naturally provide backpressure when consumers can't keep up.

## Cons

- **Resource overhead**: Each generator creates a goroutine, which has memory overhead (typically 2KB stack).
- **Complexity**: Can make code harder to understand and debug, especially with multiple nested generators.
- **Goroutine leaks**: If not properly handled, generators can leak goroutines when consumers stop reading early.
- **Error handling**: Propagating errors through generators requires additional channel coordination or context usage.
- **Testing challenges**: Concurrent code with generators can be more difficult to test reliably.

## Summary

The generator pattern is particularly powerful in Go due to its lightweight goroutines and first-class channel support, making it an excellent choice for building concurrent, memory-efficient data processing systems.

Restoring sequencing is a concurrency design pattern that solves a fundamental problem: when you fan out work to multiple goroutines for parallel processing, the results often come back in unpredictable order, but you need them in the original sequence.
Think of it like this: imagine you have a batch of letters to translate, and you give them to multiple translators working simultaneously. Each translator works at different speeds, so letter #3 might come back before letter #1. But you need to mail them out in the original order.
The core problem arises because:

You want the performance benefits of parallel processing
But you also need to maintain the original ordering of results
Simply collecting results as they arrive destroys the sequence

The restoring sequencing pattern solves this by associating each piece of work with its original position or sequence number. When you fan out the work, you include this sequence information. When results come back, you use this information to reconstruct the original order.
There are typically two approaches:
Buffered reconstruction: You collect all results in a buffer/slice indexed by sequence number, then output them in order once you have everything. This works well when you know the total count upfront.
Streaming reconstruction: You maintain a "next expected" counter and only output results when they match the expected sequence. Out-of-order results are temporarily stored until their turn comes. This allows you to stream results as soon as they're ready in the correct order.
The pattern is particularly useful in scenarios like:

Processing items from a slice where order matters
Pipeline stages where you need to maintain sequence
Batch processing where results must be delivered in order

The key insight is that you're trading some memory (to buffer out-of-order results) for the ability to maintain sequencing while still getting the performance benefits of parallel processing.
